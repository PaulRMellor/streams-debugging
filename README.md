# Streams debugging

This project contains a series of debugging sessions for Red Hat AMQ Streams. Each session is self contained, but it
assumes user level knowledge about Red Hat OpenShift and Apache Kafka. An OpenShift cluster with admin permissions is
required. The examples are not meant to be exhaustive, but just a way to introduce common configurations and tools.
Contributions are welcomed.
