# Streams debugging

This project contains a series of debugging sessions for Red Hat AMQ Streams.
They assume user level knowledge about Red Hat OpenShift and Apache Kafka.
An OpenShift cluster with admin permissions is required.
The examples are not meant to be exhaustive, but just a way to introduce common configurations and tools.
Contributions are welcomed.
